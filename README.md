# Backstory

If Classroom shows you a popup (not just a message in chat) that the student left, then you are no longer getting paid for your time, and will have to file support ticket to get your money.

I only noticed it by chance when it happened the first time last month, so I suspect it's happened before. And if it happened to me, it's probably happened to other people. 

Basically, TutorDotCom is doing wage theft. It's wage theft via incompetence , rather than malice, but it's wage theft nonetheless.

# This Script

Run it and it will look through all available log files in the `%AppDataLocal%/Tutor.com/Tutor.com Classroom/<version>/` directories.

At least for me theres a missing span of a month or two that's not anywhere to be found, not sure what's up with that. Possibly the log files are rotated, I'm not actually sure.
