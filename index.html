                            This is a tool intended for tutors contracted with Tutor.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The software we use, Classroom, has some flaws. One of these flaws is that it will,
                            sometimes, falsely detect that the student has left the session. The only visible symptom of
                            this appears to be that you receive a popup (not just a message in chat) saying that the
                            student left, even though the student is still there and the session is proceeding normally
                            otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point, you are no longer being paid for your time, and you will have to submit a
                            support ticket, along with the log file, to get paid for that missing time. It's very easy
                            to miss these incidents, which is why I created this tool that analyzes the log file and
                            tries to detect them.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Finding the Log File</h5>
                        <p>
                            The log files (plural, because Classroom keeps a separate one for each version of the
                            software) are stored in the <code>%AppDataLocal%/Tutor.com/Tutor.com Classroom/&lt;version&gt;/</code>
                            directories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For non-nerds, you can find the log file for the current version by right clicking on the
                            tray icon, clicking "about", and then clicking the link to the log file. This will open the
                            file in your default text editor. You can "save as" to save a copy to your desktop so it's
                            easy to find and upload.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to scan all the previous log files, you can use this powershell one-liner to
                            combine all the logs and output the combined log to your desktop:
                        </p>
                        <div class="card mb-3">
                            <div class="card-body" style="overflow-x: auto;">
            <pre><code class="language-powershell">
Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Tutor.com\Tutor.com Classroom\*\Log.txt" | Get-Content | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\FullLog.txt" -Encoding utf8
            </code></pre>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h5>Import Notes</h5>
                        <p>
                            This tool is not guaranteed to be perfect. Double check all results against what's shown in
                            your <a
                                href="https://prv.tutor.com/nGEN/Apps/SocWinSupportingPages/Provider/BillingInfo.aspx">billing
                            info</a>. On that linked page, if you click on your earnings, it will show the date and
                            times and how much you earned for every session that month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that the times shown on that billing info page are in Eastern Time, while your log file
                            uses your local time. The log file, as least for me as a US resident, is timestamped in US
                            format, meaning month/day/year. If you live outside the US (and more importantly, have
                            Windows set to use a non-US locale), your logfile <em>may</em> use day/month/year, in which case
                            this tool will give you completely wrong information. I really don't know if this will
                            happen or not, so if it <em>does</em>, I'd love to know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This tool uses a five minute threshold to detect events, in order to prevent false
                            positives. This is because when classroom is working correctly and the student leaves first,
                            there's always going to be a non-zero amount of time between that event and you clicking the
                            end session button.
